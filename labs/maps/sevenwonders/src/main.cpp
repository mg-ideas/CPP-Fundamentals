The solution to the Seven Wonders Problem: https://open.kattis.com/problems/sevenwonders
Algorithm steps:
1. Read cards into a string variable
2. use unordered_map<char, int> to keep track of count of each card played
  - update map: for each card, update its count
3. find regular points following the instruction
  - points = sum of (each card_count)^2
4. add bonus points if any
  - find # of sets of three cards and multiply it by 7
