Solution to Bacon, Eggs and Spam Problem
Algorithm steps:
1. Read number of lines to be processed; if 0, end reading
2. For each line, split the line into words
3. For each menu item after the first word (which is the customer name),
    add the name to the ordered set of names for that item in a map
    - note: use ordered map and ordered set to maintain alphabetical order
4. After reading all lines, print each item and the associated names in alphabetical order
